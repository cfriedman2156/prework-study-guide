# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I'm embarking on a new journey in life -- learning to code!
Creating a website was my first task before classes start, and we were assigned to make it a study guide.
I'll be referring to this website to help with the basics of Javascript, HTML, CSS and Git.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this study guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
